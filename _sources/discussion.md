In this analysis, I wanted to know if the Disney director of the single highest-grossing film would also have the highest average gross earnings for all their films in the top 20 highest-grossing Disney movies. My hypothesis turned out to be correct, largely because the movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs {numref}`snow-white`, directed by David Hand, had far higher gross earnings than any other Disney movie. This movie was released in 1937, when far fewer movies were released than today, meaning it would have little competition in the box office. David Hand didn't direct any other movies in the top 20, unlike some of the other directors in that group, and still had the highest average gross of any director. Another interesting analysis would be to expand the dataset to include a larger sample size, as some other directors may have directed more, lower grossing movies that combined would give them a higher average gross than David Hand.
